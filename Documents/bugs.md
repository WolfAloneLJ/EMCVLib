- [✔️] [[#1]](https://github.com/trmbhs/EMCVLib/issues/1) The demo will crash when stop or close the camera. When releasing the `cv::VideoCapture` object, CRASH! Perhaps this is the reason of the crash: [OpenCV #7833](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/7833). It's a bug of OpenCV for macOS. Still working on it. --- Fixed it. It's a bug of OpenCV. See: [[EMCVLib #1]](https://github.com/trmbhs/EMCVLib/issues/1)
